Hereâ€™s a strong LinkedIn post that shows impact *without being too long*:

---

> ðŸš€ **Just deployed my first ML web app!**
> 
> ðŸŽ¯ **Employee Attrition Prediction** â€” an interactive tool to help HR teams predict whether an employee is likely to leave, based on job role, income, satisfaction, and more.
> 
> ðŸ’» Built with:
> - `RandomForestClassifier` (88% accuracy)
> - `Streamlit` (for an easy-to-use web interface)
> - Kaggleâ€™s IBM HR Analytics Dataset
> 
> ðŸ§ª You can try it out live here:  
> ðŸ‘‰ https://employee-attrition-predictionmodel.streamlit.app
> 
> Itâ€™s exciting to go from a raw dataset to a fully working deployed ML product.  
> If you're starting out, don't wait to be perfect â€” just start building.
